### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Sepehr** which means **"Sky"** in the <em>Persian</em> language. Since creating something new always makes me satisfied, I  started learning programming from my childhood by [I386]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386") CPU generation and [MS-DOS]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS") OS. I have some experience in the mobile application development of Android and I am passionate about learning new technologies to utilize them in my lifestyle. I always try to find automated solutions for routine processes. I love animals and birds are my favorite species because they are always free and can travel whenever they prefer.
